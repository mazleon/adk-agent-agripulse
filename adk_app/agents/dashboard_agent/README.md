# Dashboard Agent

The **Dashboard Agent** is a specialized AI agent for AgriPulse that provides intelligent database querying and analytics capabilities through natural language interactions.

## Overview

The Dashboard Agent converts natural language questions into SQL queries, executes them safely against the Snowflake database, and presents results in a clear, actionable format.

## Features

- üîç **Natural Language to SQL**: Convert plain English questions to SQL queries
- üìä **Data Exploration**: Discover available tables, columns, and data
- üîí **Read-Only Security**: Only SELECT queries allowed, no data modification
- üìà **Analytics**: Get insights, summaries, and statistics
- üéØ **Intelligent Inference**: Automatically determines which table to query
- ‚ú® **User-Friendly**: Clear, structured data presentation

## Quick Start

### Run the Agent

```bash
# Start the dashboard agent
uv run adk run adk_app/agents/dashboard_agent
```

### Example Queries

**Explore the database**:
```
"What tables are available?"
"Show me the database schema"
"Give me a summary of the yield forecasts table"
```

**Query yield forecasts**:
```
"Show me yield forecasts for Dhaka district"
"What are the predicted yields for Aman crop in 2025?"
"List all forecasts with yield above 3 tons per hectare"
"Show me the top 5 highest predicted yields"
```

**Query crop practices**:
```
"Show me rice varieties for Aman season"
"What varieties have yield above 6 tons per hectare?"
"List varieties resistant to blast disease"
```

## Available Tools

### 1. get_database_schema()
Get information about available tables and their structure.

**Use when**:
- User asks "What tables are available?"
- User wants to understand the database structure
- Starting data exploration

### 2. generate_and_execute_query(user_query, table_name, limit)
Convert natural language to SQL and execute the query.

**Parameters**:
- `user_query` (required): Natural language question
- `table_name` (optional): Specific table to query
- `limit` (optional): Max records (default: 50, max: 100)

**Use when**:
- User asks a specific data question
- User wants to see database records
- User needs filtered or sorted data

### 3. get_table_summary(table_name)
Get statistical summary of a table.

**Parameters**:
- `table_name` (required): Table to summarize

**Use when**:
- User asks for table statistics
- User wants data coverage information
- User asks "How much data is there?"

## Example Interactions

### Data Exploration
```
User: What kind of data can I query?

Agent: Let me show you what's available in our agricultural database.

üìã Available Database Tables

1. STG_ML_YIELD_FORECASTS - ML Yield Predictions
   Contains 645 records of ML-based yield forecasts
   - Districts: Dhaka, Bagerhat, Chittagong, and more
   - Crops: Aman, Aus, Boro varieties
   - Years: 2024-2028

2. VW_STG_CROP_PRACTICE - Crop Cultivation Practices
   Contains variety information and best practices
   - Crop types: Rice, wheat, maize

### Specific Query
```
User: Show me yield forecasts for Dhaka in 2025

Agent: Let me retrieve the yield forecasts for Dhaka district in 2025.

üìä Yield Forecasts for Dhaka - 2025 (3 records found)

1. High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman
   - Predicted Yield: 2.85 tons/hectare
   - Confidence Range: 2.60 - 3.10 tons/hectare
   - Model: Ensemble

2. Aman (Broadcast)
   - Predicted Yield: 2.45 tons/hectare
   - Confidence Range: 2.20 - 2.70 tons/hectare
   - Model: Ensemble

## Integration

The dashboard agent can be integrated with other agents in a multi-agent system:

```python
from adk_app.agents.dashboard_agent.agent import dashboard_agent
from adk_app.agents.yield_agent.agent import yield_agent
from adk_app.agents.weather.agent import weather_agent

# Use in coordinator
coordinator = Agent(
    name="coordinator",
    agents=[weather_agent, yield_agent, dashboard_agent]
)
```

## Limitations

- **Read-only**: Cannot modify data (by design)
- **Query complexity**: Simple pattern-based SQL generation
- **Result limits**: Maximum 100 records per query
- **Table coverage**: Only configured tables accessible

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced SQL generation using LLM
- Data visualization capabilities
- Query caching for performance
- Export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- Saved query templates
- Real-time data streaming

## Support
