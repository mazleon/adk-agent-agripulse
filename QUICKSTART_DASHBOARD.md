# üöÄ Dashboard Agent - Quick Start Guide

## What is the Dashboard Agent?

The Dashboard Agent is an AI-powered database assistant that converts your natural language questions into SQL queries and retrieves data from the Snowflake agricultural database.

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Run the Agent
```bash
uv run adk run adk_app/agents/dashboard_agent
```

### 2. Ask Questions
Start with:
```
"What tables are available?"
```

### 3. Explore Data
Try these queries:
```
"Show me yield forecasts for Dhaka district"
"What rice varieties are best for Aman season?"
"List all forecasts with yield above 3 tons per hectare"
```

## Common Queries

### üìä Explore the Database
```
"What data is available?"
"Show me the database schema"
"Give me a summary of the yield forecasts table"
"How many records are in the database?"
```

### üåæ Yield Forecasts
```
"Show yield forecasts for Dhaka in 2025"
"What are the top 5 highest predicted yields?"
"List all Aman crop forecasts"
"Show me forecasts with confidence above 90%"
"Compare yields across districts"
```

### üå± Crop Practices
```
"Show rice varieties for Aman season"
"What varieties yield above 6 tons per hectare?"
"List varieties resistant to blast disease"
"Show varieties released after 2000"
"What's the best variety for rainfed conditions?"
```

### üìà Analytics
```
"What's the average yield by district?"
"Show yield trends over years"
"Which district has the highest yields?"
"Compare Aman and Boro varieties"
```

## Available Tables

### STG_ML_YIELD_FORECASTS
ML-based yield predictions (645 records)
- **Districts**: Dhaka, Bagerhat, Chittagong, Mymensingh, etc.
- **Crops**: Aman, Aus, Boro varieties
- **Years**: 2024-2028
- **Data**: Predicted yields, confidence intervals, ML models

### VW_STG_CROP_PRACTICE
Crop cultivation best practices
- **Crops**: Rice, wheat, maize
- **Seasons**: Aman, Boro, Aus, Rabi, Kharif
- **Data**: Varieties, yield potential, disease resistance

## Tips for Better Results

### ‚úÖ Do This
- Be specific: "Show Dhaka forecasts for 2025"
- Use proper names: "Aman", "Dhaka", "rice"
- Ask for summaries: "Give me a summary of..."
- Request top results: "Show top 5..."

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- Too vague: "Show me data"
- Misspellings: "Daka" instead of "Dhaka"
- Complex joins: Agent handles simple queries best
- Data modification: Read-only access only

## Example Session
