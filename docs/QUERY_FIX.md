# 🔧 Query Logic Fix - Issue Resolved

## ❌ Problem Identified

From the screenshot, the agent was returning incorrect results:

**User Asked For:**
- Crop type: rice
- Yield variety: High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman  
- Location: Dhaka
- Time: 2025
- Season: aman

**Agent Returned:**
- Crop Type: **(Broadcast+L.T + HYV) Aman** ❌ WRONG
- Season: Aman (assumed) ❌ User provided it, not assumed

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **Issue 1: Multiple LIKE Conditions**
The old code was adding multiple LIKE conditions with AND:
```sql
WHERE LOWER(CROP_TYPE) LIKE '%rice%'
  AND LOWER(CROP_TYPE) LIKE '%HYV%'
  AND LOWER(CROP_TYPE) LIKE '%Aman%'
```
This would match ANY crop type containing all these terms, leading to wrong results.

### **Issue 2: "Rice" is Not a Valid Crop Type**
- Database has: "High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman", "(Broadcast+L.T + HYV) Aman"
- User said: "rice"
- These don't match! "Rice" is a general term, not a specific variety.

### **Issue 3: Season is Redundant**
- Season (Aman, Aus, Boro) is ALREADY part of the CROP_TYPE field
- No need for separate season parameter
- Treating it separately caused confusion

### **Issue 4: Too Many Optional Parameters**
Old function signature:
```python
def get_yield_forecast_from_db(
    crop_type: Optional[str] = None,      # Confusing
    yield_variety: Optional[str] = None,  # Confusing
    district: Optional[str] = None,       # Should be required
    forecast_year: Optional[int] = None,  # Should be required
    season: Optional[str] = None,         # Redundant
    limit: int = 10
)
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Simplified Function Signature**

**New signature:**
```python
def get_yield_forecast_from_db(
    yield_variety: Optional[str] = None,  # REQUIRED - exact variety name
    district: Optional[str] = None,        # REQUIRED - district name
    forecast_year: Optional[int] = None,   # REQUIRED - year
    limit: int = 10
)
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed `crop_type` (confusing, redundant with yield_variety)
- ✅ Removed `season` (already part of crop type)
- ✅ Made parameters effectively required (returns error if missing)
- ✅ Clear documentation about what each parameter means

### **2. Exact Matching Query**

**New query logic:**
```sql
WHERE LOWER(CROP_TYPE) LIKE LOWER(%(yield_variety)s)  -- Partial match on variety
  AND LOWER(DISTRICT_NAME) = LOWER(%(district)s)      -- Exact match on district
  AND FORECAST_YEAR = %(forecast_year)s               -- Exact match on year
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Single LIKE condition for variety (allows partial matching)
- ✅ Exact match on district and year
- ✅ No more combining multiple conditions incorrectly

### **3. Required Parameter Validation**

```python
if not yield_variety:
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "error_message": "yield_variety is required",
        "suggestion": "Use get_available_crop_types() to see all varieties"
    }
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Validates all required parameters
- ✅ Returns helpful error messages
- ✅ Suggests using discovery tools

### **4. Updated Agent Guidance**

**New agent behavior:**
```
User: "I want rice forecast for Dhaka in 2025"

Agent: "I see you want rice forecasts. Let me show you the available varieties:

[Calls get_available_crop_types()]

Available rice varieties:
1. High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman
2. (Broadcast+L.T + HYV) Aman

Which variety would you like forecasts for?"

User: "HYV Aman"

Agent: [Calls get_yield_forecast_from_db(
    yield_variety="High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman",
    district="Dhaka",
    forecast_year=2025
)]
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Case: User's Scenario**

```bash
uv run python scripts/test_correct_query.py
```

**Input:**
- yield_variety: "High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman"
- district: "Dhaka"
- forecast_year: 2025

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Found 1 forecast(s)!

Forecast Details:
  - Crop Type: High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman  ✅ CORRECT
  - District: Dhaka
  - Forecast Year: 2025
  - Predicted Yield: 2.50 tons/hectare
  - Confidence Range: 2.45 to 2.55
```

**Result:** ✅ **PASS** - Returns correct variety, no assumptions

---

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

### **Before (❌ Incorrect)**

**User Input:**
```
crop_type: "rice"
yield_variety: "HYV Aman"
location: "Dhaka"
year: 2025
season: "aman"
```

**Agent Behavior:**
- Combined all parameters with AND
- Matched "(Broadcast+L.T + HYV) Aman" (wrong variety)
- Said "Season: Aman (assumed)" even though user provided it

**Result:** ❌ Wrong crop type returned

### **After (✅ Correct)**

**User Input:**
```
"I want rice forecast for Dhaka in 2025"
```

**Agent Behavior:**
1. Recognizes "rice" is too general
2. Calls `get_available_crop_types()` to show options
3. User clarifies: "HYV Aman"
4. Calls `get_yield_forecast_from_db(yield_variety="High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman", district="Dhaka", forecast_year=2025)`
5. Returns exact match

**Result:** ✅ Correct crop type returned

---

## 📝 Important Notes for Agent

### **Database Structure Understanding**

**CROP_TYPE field contains:**
- "High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman"
- "(Broadcast+L.T + HYV) Aman"

**NOT:**
- "rice" (too general)
- "Aman" alone (incomplete)
- Separate "season" field (doesn't exist)

### **Correct Parameter Usage**

**Required for every query:**
```python
yield_variety = "High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman"  # Exact or partial match
district = "Dhaka"                                   # Exact match
forecast_year = 2025                                 # Exact match
```

**When user says "rice":**
1. Call `get_available_crop_types()`
2. Show user the actual varieties
3. Ask user to choose
4. Use the exact variety name they choose

### **Never Do This:**
- ❌ Search for "rice" directly
- ❌ Combine crop_type + season
- ❌ Assume which variety user wants
- ❌ Say "assumed" when user provided info

### **Always Do This:**
- ✅ Show available varieties first
- ✅ Use exact variety names from database
- ✅ Validate all required parameters
- ✅ Provide clear error messages
