## üéì Complete Workflow Example

### **Scenario: User doesn't know what to ask**

```
User: I want yield forecasts but don't know what's available

Agent: I can help you explore our forecast database! Let me show you what's available.

[Calls get_available_crop_types]

We have forecasts for these crop types:
- (Broadcast+L.T + HYV) Aman
- High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman

[Calls get_available_districts]

And we cover 73 districts across Bangladesh, including:
- Bagerhat, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, and many more

[Calls get_available_forecast_years]

Forecasts are available for years 2024-2028.

What would you like to know? For example:
- "Show me Aman forecasts for Bagerhat in 2024"
- "What's the yield forecast for HYV Aman in Dhaka?"

User: Show me Aman forecasts for Bagerhat in 2024

Agent: [Calls get_yield_forecast_from_db with filters]

Here are the Aman forecasts for Bagerhat in 2024:
- Predicted Yield: 2.34 tons/hectare
- Confidence Range: 2.11 - 2.57 tons/hectare
- Model: Ensemble

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Tool Functions**

#### 1. `get_available_crop_types()`

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    CROP_TYPE,
    COUNT(*) as forecast_count
FROM DEV_DATA_ML_DB.DATA_ML_SCHEMA.STG_ML_YIELD_FORECASTS
GROUP BY CROP_TYPE
ORDER BY forecast_count DESC, CROP_TYPE
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
    "status": "success",

            "forecast_count": 325
        },
        {
            "crop_type": "High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman",
            "forecast_count": 320
        }
    ],
