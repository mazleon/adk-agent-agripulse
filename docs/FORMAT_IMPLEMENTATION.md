## 🧪 Testing

### **Test the Format**

```bash
# Run the yield agent
uv run adk run adk_app/agents/yield_agent
```

**Try these queries:**

1. **"What's the yield forecast for HYV Aman in Dhaka for 2025?"**
   
   Expected format:
   ```
   Here is the yield forecast for High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman rice in Dhaka for 2025:
   
   * From our standard best practice:
     - Predicted Yield: Will be implemented later
   
   * From our historical analysis:
     - Predicted Yield: 2.50 tons per hectare
     - Confidence Interval: 2.45 to 2.55 tons per hectare
   ```

2. **"Show me the latest yield forecasts"**
   
   Expected format: Multiple forecasts, each following the same format

## 📝 Format Rules Summary

### **Must Include:**
1. ✅ Opening line: "Here is the yield forecast for..."
2. ✅ Full crop type + "rice" + district + year
3. ✅ "From our standard best practice" section
4. ✅ "Will be implemented later" text
5. ✅ "From our historical analysis" section
6. ✅ Predicted yield (2 decimals)
7. ✅ Confidence interval (2 decimals)

## 🎯 Agent Behavior

The agent will now:

1. **Query Database** → Get forecast data
2. **Extract Values** → Crop type, district, year, predicted yield, confidence interval
3. **Format Response** → Use the standard template
4. **Present to User** → Consistent, professional format

**Every single yield forecast response will follow this exact format!**
