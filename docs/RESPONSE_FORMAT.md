## üîß Implementation Guide

### **Step 1: Get Data from Database**

```python
result = get_yield_forecast_from_db(
    yield_variety="High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman",
    district="Dhaka",
    forecast_year=2025
)

forecast = result['forecasts'][0]
```

### **Step 2: Extract Values**

```python
crop_type = forecast['crop_type']           # "High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman"
district = forecast['district_name']        # "Dhaka"
year = forecast['forecast_year']            # 2025
predicted = forecast['predicted_yield']     # 2.50
conf_lower = forecast['confidence_lower']   # 2.45
conf_upper = forecast['confidence_upper']   # 2.55
```

### **Step 3: Format Response**

```python
response = f"""Here is the yield forecast for {crop_type} rice in {district} for {year}:

* From our standard best practice:
  - Predicted Yield: Will be implemented later

* From our historical analysis:
  - Predicted Yield: {predicted:.2f} tons per hectare
  - Confidence Interval: {conf_lower:.2f} to {conf_upper:.2f} tons per hectare"""
```

- [ ] Includes "From our historical analysis" section
- [ ] Shows actual predicted yield from database
- [ ] Shows confidence interval with lower and upper bounds
- [ ] Numbers formatted to 2 decimal places
- [ ] Includes "tons per hectare" unit
- [ ] Uses correct bullet points and indentation
- [ ] Ends with colon after opening line

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **Mistake 1: Missing "rice"**
```
‚ùå "Here is the yield forecast for HYV Aman in Dhaka for 2025:"
‚úÖ "Here is the yield forecast for High Yielding Variety (HYV) Aman rice in Dhaka for 2025:"
```

### **Mistake 2: Wrong Standard Best Practice Text**
```
‚ùå "- Predicted Yield: Coming soon"
‚ùå "- Predicted Yield: Not available"
‚úÖ "- Predicted Yield: Will be implemented later"
```

### **Mistake 3: Missing Confidence Interval**
```
‚ùå "- Predicted Yield: 2.50 tons per hectare"
‚úÖ "- Predicted Yield: 2.50 tons per hectare
    - Confidence Interval: 2.45 to 2.55 tons per hectare"
```

### **Mistake 4: Wrong Number Format**
```
‚ùå "- Predicted Yield: 2.5 tons per hectare"        (1 decimal)
‚ùå "- Predicted Yield: 2.501234 tons per hectare"   (too many decimals)
‚úÖ "- Predicted Yield: 2.50 tons per hectare"       (2 decimals)
```

### **Mistake 5: Missing Sections**
```
‚ùå Only showing historical analysis (missing standard best practice)
‚ùå Only showing standard best practice (missing historical analysis)
‚úÖ Always show BOTH sections
```

## üìö Additional Information (Optional)

After the main forecast, you can optionally add:

```
**Additional Information:**
- Model Used: Ensemble
- Prediction Date: 2025-08-24
- Source: Snowflake ML Database

**Factors Affecting Yield:**
- Soil quality and fertility
- Weather conditions during growing season
- Irrigation availability
- Pest and disease management
```

---

## üéØ Summary

**The format has TWO required sections:**

1. **Standard Best Practice** ‚Üí Always shows "Will be implemented later"
2. **Historical Analysis** ‚Üí Shows actual data from database

**Always include:**
- Full crop type name + "rice"
- District name
- Forecast year
- Predicted yield (2 decimals)
- Confidence interval (2 decimals)
- Proper bullet points and indentation

**This format ensures:**
- ‚úÖ Consistency across all responses
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of future vs current capabilities
- ‚úÖ Professional presentation
- ‚úÖ Easy to read and understand
- ‚úÖ Includes confidence intervals for transparency

## üöÄ Quick Reference

**Copy this template for every forecast:**

```
Here is the yield forecast for [CROP_TYPE] rice in [DISTRICT] for [YEAR]:

* From our standard best practice:
  - Predicted Yield: Will be implemented later

* From our historical analysis:
  - Predicted Yield: [X.XX] tons per hectare
  - Confidence Interval: [X.XX] to [X.XX] tons per hectare
```

**Replace:**
- `[CROP_TYPE]` ‚Üí Full variety name from database
- `[DISTRICT]` ‚Üí District name
- `[YEAR]` ‚Üí Forecast year
- `[X.XX]` ‚Üí Actual values from database (2 decimal places)
